# Token Solidity Contract

The Token Solidity Contract is a smart contract written in Solidity, designed to facilitate the creation and management of the Effort Point (EP) token. This README provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the EP Token Contract.

## Description

The Token Contract enables the creation of the  token.
The contract consists of the following key components:

### Token Details: 
The contract stores the details of the  token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply. These details can be accessed publicly.

### Address Balances: 
The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances, allowing for easy tracking of token ownership and balance for each address.

### Minting Tokens: 
The contract provides a mint function that enables the creation of new tokens. 

### Burning Tokens: 
The contract includes a burn function to remove  tokens from circulation. 

## Procedure

To interact with the Ember Token Contract, follow these steps:

1.Set up an Ethereum development environment, such as Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

2.Create a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., EmberToken.sol).

3.Copy and paste the provided Ember Token Contract code into the file.

4.Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version (e.g., pragma solidity 0.8.18) and clicking the "Compile" button.

5.Deploy the contract by selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, choosing the Token contract from the dropdown menu, and clicking the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions, providing the necessary parameters. Ensure that you have the required Ether balance to cover the gas fees for executing the transactions.
